# Neural Network and Logistic Regression

## Neural Network

A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). The goal of logistic regression is to find the best fitting model to describe the relationship between the dichotomous characteristic of interest and a set of independent variables.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used for predicting the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the linear relationship between the variables and to make predictions based on this relationship.
